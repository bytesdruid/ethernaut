# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Running scripts
yarn hardhat run .\scripts\Deployment.ts
Running scripts with arguments
yarn run ts-node --files .\scripts\Deployment.ts "arg1" "arg2" "arg3"
